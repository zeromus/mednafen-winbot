Warnings:
this repository is really big, ~600MB of git data.

Prerequisites: 
git installed to "C:\Program Files (x86)\git\bin" or "C:\Program Files\git\bin" or somewhere reachable by %PATH%

Instructions: 
run build.bat; look for results in .out32 and .out64.

You may run build-other.bat which has baked-in urls of preferred mirrors.

Both 32 and 64 builds will try to run. If you're on a 32bit system, the 64bit builds will probably blow up or something.
